* A class is a group of attributes and methods.
* Attributes are variables that contain the data.
* Method performs an action or a task.
* object class is the base class of all Python classes.
* __init__(): It is a special type of method also known as constructor. It is used to initialize the variables of an object.
We do not call this method explicitly. Python automatically calls it as soon as we create an object of the class.

* self is a variable (not a keyword) that refers the current object. It contains the memory address of the current object.
self is the first argument of any object method (instance method). Python does that automatically for us.

* An object is a class type variable. Python allocates memory only when we create object of the class. The size of allocated memory is decided on the basis of attributes and methods available in the class. Once the memory is allocated, Python calls the __init__() method internally to store the initial value of object's variables. The allocated memory address is passed to self.

* Each time we create an object of the class, a copy of each variables defined in the class is created.
* A constructor is called only once for each object.


* Calling class method through constructor: We can call a class method from the constructor using ClassName.classmethod() or self.__class__.classmethod().
* We can access a class variable from the constructor using ClassName.classvar or self.__class__.classvar.
* self.__class__ is preferred if inheritance is possible.


* Use ** operator to calculate powers (e.g., x ** 2 for square, x ** 0.5 for square root).
* Use math.sqrt(x) to calculate square root (import math module first).
* math.sqrt(x) is more readable for square root compared to x ** 0.5
